Here you would find a Jupyter notebook (i.e., Lagragian_Air_quality.ipynb) created by Casallas et al. (submitted) doi: . 
The notebook is self explanatory since it has many comments, and also an example to reproduce some of the plots that can be found in the main text and the SM of the paper
We add here (or in a drive link) the files needed to run the examples to make the use of the tracker easier and friendly

Data from gound-base stations: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LpDeaKP3UlNrdyYf5vvgEFF3_QgwVzIi?usp=sharing
The Pollutant_trend_data has a directory called Hourmean which is the one used in the notebook example. The data there is already processed, by calculating each city hour mean.
If you want the raw data, the main directory has directories which the name of each pollutant.

CAMS DATA: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lioe0wWy_S9JKqLDmx5bb5YzlxMfrZuY?usp=sharing
It is important to mention that the data from CAMS is already processed so that the units are ug m-3 (i.e., SO2 and O3). 
The notebook also include the link to make this processing, but meteorological data is needed to do it.
